<h1>About Introduce Me</h1>
<h2>What is Introduce Me?</h2>
<p>Introduce Me is a web app for introducing people to each other. You can introduce people for any reason you like. Connect people for friendship, connect people who’d make good business partners, or even play cupid and connect people who are a good match for a relationship.</p>

<h2>Which social networks does Introduce Me work with?</h2>
<p>You can use Introduce Me to introduce your friends on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You can send cross-network introductions. For example you can introduce one of your Facebook friends with one of your LinkedIn friends.</p>

<h2>What happens when I make an introduction?</h2>
<p>After you select two friends and click ‘Send’, Introduce Me will send a message to each friend. The message might be sent as an email or on Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter. The message will contain a link to your introduction page, where you and the two people you introduce can have a private discussion.</p>

<h2>How does privacy work?</h2>
<p>The names and profile pictures of the people you introduce are publicly viewable (for example in a tweet or Wall post). However any messages that you send will only be shown to the people you introduce.</p>

<h2>Is there a mobile version?</h2>
<p>No, currently there is only one interface for Introduce Me.</p>
